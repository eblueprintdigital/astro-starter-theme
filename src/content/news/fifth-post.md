# Accessibility Best Practices

Creating an accessible website means ensuring that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with your site effectively.

## Why Accessibility Matters

- **Inclusivity**: Reach a wider audience
- **Legal Compliance**: Avoid potential lawsuits
- **Better SEO**: Many accessibility practices improve SEO
- **Improved Usability**: Accessible sites are often more usable for everyone

According to the World Health Organization, over a billion people (about 15% of the world's population) have some form of disability. Designing with accessibility in mind ensures your content is available to this significant portion of users.

## Essential Accessibility Practices

1. **Semantic HTML**: Use appropriate elements for their intended purpose
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all functionality is accessible via keyboard
3. **Alternative Text**: Provide descriptive alt text for images
4. **Color Contrast**: Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background
5. **Focus Indicators**: Make it clear which element has keyboard focus

Remember that accessibility is not a checklist but a continuous commitment to inclusive design. Regular testing with accessibility tools and real users with disabilities can help identify areas for improvement.
