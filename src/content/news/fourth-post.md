# Optimizing Website Performance

Website performance is crucial for user experience and SEO. In this article, we'll explore practical ways to optimize your site's performance.

## Why Performance Matters

- **User Experience**: Users abandon slow sites
- **Conversion Rates**: Faster sites convert better
- **SEO Rankings**: Speed is a ranking factor
- **Accessibility**: Performance is an accessibility concern

According to studies, a 1-second delay in page load time can result in a 7% reduction in conversions. That's why optimizing your site's performance should be a priority.

## Key Optimization Strategies

1. **Optimize Images**: Compress and properly size images
2. **Minimize HTTP Requests**: Combine files and use sprites
3. **Enable Browser Caching**: Set appropriate cache headers
4. **Use CDNs**: Distribute your content globally
5. **Minify CSS and JavaScript**: Remove unnecessary characters

Remember, performance optimization is an ongoing process, not a one-time task. Regularly test your site's performance and make improvements where necessary.
