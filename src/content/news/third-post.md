# How to Use Astro Components Effectively

Astro components are the building blocks of your Astro project. In this article, we'll explore how to use them effectively.

## Key Benefits of Astro Components

- **Zero JavaScript by default**: Ship less JavaScript to the browser
- **Island Architecture**: Add interactivity only where needed
- **Server-first API design**: Move expensive work to the build step
- **Hybrid Rendering**: Choose between static and dynamic for each route

Astro's component syntax is designed to feel familiar to anyone who's worked with HTML or JSX before. The most unique feature is how Astro separates your component's JavaScript and UI, using a special `---` fence.

## Advanced Techniques

When building more complex sites, you might need to leverage some advanced techniques:

1. **Component Props**: Pass data between components
2. **Slots**: Insert children into your components
3. **JavaScript Expressions**: Use dynamic values in your templates
