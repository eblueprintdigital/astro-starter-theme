        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          The Astro Starter Theme was created to help developers quickly build
          beautiful, performant websites with a simplified CSS reset and modern
          best practices. Our goal is to provide a solid foundation that gives
          you the structure you need without getting in your way.
        </p>

        <p>
          We believe in the power of web standards and the importance of
          delivering fast, accessible experiences to users. Our theme is built
          with progressive enhancement in mind, ensuring your site works well
          for everyone, regardless of their device or internet connection.
